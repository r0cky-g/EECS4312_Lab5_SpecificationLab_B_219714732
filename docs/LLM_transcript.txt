Prompt 1: 

Context:

You are asked to implement a Python function that determines whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacity. The function takes as input a list of requests and available resources and returns whether a valid allocation exists. The goal is to determine feasibility of allocation based on the provided information. You may assume inputs are provided in a reasonable and consistent format. You may use ChatGPT to assist with reasoning about the problem, generating code, or writing tests.

Question: What is the objective of the system?

LLM Response 1: 

The objective of the system is to **determine whether a feasible allocation exists**—that is, to check if the available resources can satisfy all the given resource requests **without exceeding capacity constraints**.

In simpler terms:
👉 Given what’s available and what’s being requested, the system’s goal is to decide **“Is it possible to allocate resources so everyone’s needs are met?”**

Prompt 2: 

Can you suggest 6 acceptance criteria using the Given-When-Then format.

LLM Response 2: 

Sure! Here are **six acceptance criteria** written in **Given–When–Then** format, covering common and edge-case scenarios for the resource allocation feasibility function:

---

1. **All requests fit within capacity**
   **Given** a list of resource requests whose total does not exceed the available capacity
   **When** the allocation feasibility function is executed
   **Then** the function returns `True`

---

2. **Requests exceed total capacity**
   **Given** a list of resource requests whose total exceeds the available capacity
   **When** the allocation feasibility function is executed
   **Then** the function returns `False`

---

3. **Exact capacity match**
   **Given** a list of resource requests whose total exactly equals the available capacity
   **When** the allocation feasibility function is executed
   **Then** the function returns `True`

---

4. **Empty request list**
   **Given** an empty list of resource requests
   **When** the allocation feasibility function is executed
   **Then** the function returns `True`

---

5. **Single request exceeds capacity**
   **Given** a list containing a single request that is greater than the available capacity
   **When** the allocation feasibility function is executed
   **Then** the function returns `False`

---

6. **Multiple resource types with independent constraints**
   **Given** requests and available resources defined for multiple resource types (e.g., CPU and memory) where at least one resource type exceeds its capacity
   **When** the allocation feasibility function is executed
   **Then** the function returns `False`

---

If you’d like, I can also help convert these into **unit tests** or tailor them to a **specific data structure** you have in mind.


--------------------------------------------------

Prompt 3:

Suggest 6 constraints and assumptions relevant to the problem.

LLM Response 3:

Here are **six key constraints and assumptions** that are relevant to the resource allocation feasibility problem:

---

1. **Resources are finite and fixed**
   The total available resources are limited and do not change during the execution of the allocation check.

---

2. **Requests are non-negative and well-formed**
   Each resource request specifies a valid, non-negative amount and follows the expected input format.

---

3. **Requests must be fully satisfied or not at all**
   Partial fulfillment of a request is not allowed; each request either receives its full required resources or the allocation is deemed infeasible.

---

4. **Resource types must align between requests and capacity**
   All resource types requested must exist in the available resources definition, and no unknown or unsupported resource types are allowed.

---

5. **Order of requests does not affect feasibility**
   The feasibility result depends only on total demand versus total capacity, not on the order in which requests are processed.

---

6. **No side effects or state changes**
   The function performs a pure feasibility check and does not mutate the input data or perform actual allocation.

---

If you want, I can also help translate these into **code-level invariants**, **validation rules**, or **documentation comments**.

Prompt 4:

This is the starter code I was given:

rom typing import Dict, List, Union

Number = Union[int, float]


def is_allocation_feasible(
    resources: Dict[str, Number],
    requests: List[Dict[str, Number]]
) -> bool:
    """
    Determine whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacities.

    Args:
        resources : Dict[str, Number], Mapping from resource name to total available capacity.
        requests : List[Dict[str, Number]], List of requests. Each request is a mapping from resource name to the amount required.

    Returns:
        True if the allocation is feasible, False otherwise.

    """
    # TODO: Implement this function
    raise NotImplementedError("suggest_slots function has not been implemented yet")

Using the context given, can you suggest one possible implementation?

LLM Response 4:

Yep! Given the context and the starter code, here’s a **clean, reasonable implementation** that checks feasibility by ensuring total requested amounts do not exceed available resources for each resource type.

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Union

Number = Union[int, float]


def is_allocation_feasible(
    resources: Dict[str, Number],
    requests: List[Dict[str, Number]]
) -> bool:
    """
    Determine whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacities.
    """
    # Track total usage per resource
    total_requested: Dict[str, Number] = {}

    for request in requests:
        for resource, amount in request.items():
            # Invalid request: negative usage
            if amount < 0:
                return False

            total_requested[resource] = total_requested.get(resource, 0) + amount

            # Resource not available or exceeded capacity
            if resource not in resources:
                return False
            if total_requested[resource] > resources[resource]:
                return False

    return True
```

### Why this works

* Aggregates usage per resource across all requests
* Fails fast if:

  * A request asks for an unknown resource
  * A request is negative
  * Capacity is exceeded at any point
* Returns `True` only if *all* constraints are satisfied

If you want, I can also:

* Add input validation (types, empty checks)
* Optimize for large inputs
* Write unit tests for this implementation

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt 5:

Clarify: At least one resource must remain unallocated after assignment.

LLM Response 5:

It means this:

After you finish assigning resources (people, machines, budget units, etc.) to tasks, **you are not allowed to use all of them**.
There must be **at least one resource left unused**.

In more concrete terms:

* If you have **N resources total**, you may assign **at most N − 1** of them.
* A solution that uses **every single resource** is **invalid**.
* A solution that leaves **one or more resources idle** is valid.

Example:

* You have 5 servers and tasks that could use all 5.

  * Assigning 4 servers → ✅ valid
  * Assigning all 5 servers → ❌ not allowed

If you want, tell me the context (math problem, optimization model, scheduling rules, etc.), and I can restate it in the exact formal language you need.
